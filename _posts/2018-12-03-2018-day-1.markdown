I'm trying [Advent of Code](//adventofcode.com) thanks to prompting by [Rocky](//twitter.com/rockyroer). I had looked at the 2017 challenges, but felt super overwhelmed by the complexity of the challenges. A year later, I felt...okay...with starting. Here's my Day 1 solution.

## Part 1
Sum all frequencies

```python
def sumall(list):
    # Start at 0

    sum = 0

    # Loop each value in the list, adding to the sum

    for item in list:
        sum += item

    return sum

sum = sumall(raw)
print('Frequency: ', sum) # 529
```

## Part 2
I started with a list that was checked with each addition, but it took more than two minutes and still hadn't returned a value. After some refreshing my Python knowledge, I switched to a set because it exits on a duplicate value.

```python
seen = set()
# Use cycle to loop the input list as many times as needed

from itertools import cycle

def sum(list):

    # Start at 0

    sum = 0

    # loop the list as many times as necessary

    for n in cycle(list):


        # Create the sum and check it against { seen }

        # If it is there, return the value.
        sum += n
        if sum in seen:
            return sum

        # If not there, add the value to the set and continue

        else:
            seen.add(sum)

repeat = sum(raw)
print('First repeat: ', repeat) # 464

```
